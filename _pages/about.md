Welcome. I provide professional copy-editing and proofreading services to higher degree research students and academics. 

I assist with doctoral theses and exegeses, journal articles, books and reports across a variety of fields.

I am a professional member of the <a href="https://www.iped-editors.org/">Institute of Professional Editors</a> and have been involved in many aspects of academic publishing and professional media production, including proofreading, copy-editing, indexing, news sub-editing, archives development, and photographic and video production.

My doctoral study focused on research methods in visual ethnography and post/subcultural theory, and my masters research was in the area of ethics and legal studies with a media focus.

Contact me via [email](mailto:desdevlin@gmail.com) to discuss your requirements. 

For HDR students, the following posts may be helpful in preparing your thesis:

- [Putting your brief in order](/articles/2022/putting-your-brief-in-order/)
- [Some style considerations](/articles/2022/some-style-considerations/)
- [Using a reference manager](/articles/2022/using-a-reference-manager/)
